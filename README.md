## Intro

This is all based on Johan Nordberg's Wintersmith. It is **exactly** the same. I just converted mostly to promises for the ff reasons:

- I plan to use it personally to extend its functionalities, *more than* being a static site generator. 
- I didn't like callbacks. Going to need a better code base to understand how he did everything. (Its originally written in coffeescript);
- I wanted to learn and train myself... read his code and converted for 9 hours straight.
